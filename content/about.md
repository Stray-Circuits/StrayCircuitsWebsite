## Who?

Hi! I'm Zach. I'm a professional Software Engineer by trade and a Musician, Guitar player, and all around DIY enthusiast at heart. I have a Masters Degree in Electrical Engineering, but more importantly I have been modifying my own guitar electronics, pedals and amps for over a decade. I have a natural inclination to dive *deep* into all of my hobbies, even outside of music - coffee, mechanical keyboards, 3D printing, and more.

## Cats

Our pets are our greatest inspiration and, simply put, cats are the best. If you're not following, I suggest visiting [your local SPCA](https://www.ecosia.org/search?q=my+local+spca&addon=opensearch) to rescue a cat in need and vastly improve your own life in the processes.

## Circuits

We stand on the shoulders of giants. Each circuit I design is influenced by multiple preexisting circuits, both well known and underappreciated.

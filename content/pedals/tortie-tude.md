### Sound

The Tortie Tude is a low gain overdrive pedal inspired by your green favorites, but without the hissing and hair balls. This pedal can sunbathe in the mix, or poke through with a single claw.

### Controls
What makes the Tortie Tude different from it's ancestors is the amount of mid shaping control it provides. The filters can be adjusted to provide an acute mid bump at one of three different frequencies, or to create a medium to wide band boost across the full mid range. Alternatively, the filters can be set to provide a mid scoop, which can be further emphasized with the **spec** control.

- **Volume** loudness of the output level.
- **Gain** level of the signal into the clipping amplifier feedback loop.
- **Spec** Controls the emphasis of the low mids (250Hz) and highs (2kHz) in the spectrum.
- **Pre** Selects the high pass filter frequency in the gain stage feedback loop.
- **Post** Selects the low pass filter frequency after the clipping stage.
- **Blend/+Cut** This three position switch enabled as 50/50 clean blend of the input signal.
  - Up: clean blend
  - Middle: no blend
  - Down: clean blend with 250Hz Low pass filter

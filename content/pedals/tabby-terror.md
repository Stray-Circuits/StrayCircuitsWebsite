### Sound

The Tabby Terror is a medium-high gain distortion pedal with cattitude. This pedal can provide anywhere from a growl to a spitting hiss.

### Controls

The **Volume** and **Gain** knobs are straight ahead - loudness and distortion controls. The other three knobs adjust the post-gain EQ of the pedal using both passive and active circuitry.

- ***f*** adjusts the low pass filter, just like the distortion pedals you know and love.
- **Low** controls a wide-band filter at 120Hz
- **Hi** controls a wide-band filter at 4kHz

Max out the **Gain**, **Hi**, or **Low** controls to go from growl to snarl and break into fuzz territory, or max out multiple for full on arched-back hair raised terror.
